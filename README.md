## Motivation

Sometimes you need to do some clean up or transform for texts in batches. You can either edit manually line-by-line, using multi-cursors in your editor, apply find & replace with RegExp, or write a script for that.

Editing manually sometime could be laborious, writing a script could be complicated and overkill. Replacing via RegExp sounds like a good options to me, but somehow most editors can only do replacement but lack of the feature "keep only what matched".

Introducing **ReX**, an tiny app for me to do the text transformation without causing my headache. It was wrote in like 4 hours, but I will try to add more features as needed along the way.

So, yeah, enjoy. I would be glad if you find it useful as well.
